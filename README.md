As part of [ADIS2020](https://www.mpie.de/4433801/adis2020) we had two hands-on programming sessions with the results collected here.

## Structural analysis using pyiron and pyscal
We tried a few methods to find vacancies in bulk structures as well tried to get some intuitive understanding of steinhardt parameters and what subset is most useful for structure identification.

## Decohesion Zone Model
See e.g. [here](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.033603)
We looked a bit into elastic behaviour and crack formation under hydrogen influence using a very simple decohesion zone model.
